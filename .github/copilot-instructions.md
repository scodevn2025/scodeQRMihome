# ScodeQRMihome - Xiaomi Mijia Smart Home Control

**ALWAYS follow these instructions first and fallback to search or bash commands only when you encounter unexpected information that does not match the info here.**

ScodeQRMihome is a Next.js TypeScript web application for managing Xiaomi Mijia smart home devices. It features a cyberpunk-themed UI with QR code authentication, device control dashboard, and API integration with Xiaomi's Mijia ecosystem.

## Working Effectively

### Prerequisites and Initial Setup
- Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
  - Takes approximately 12-40 seconds to complete (12s with cache, 40s clean install)
  - NEVER CANCEL: Wait for full completion
  - Installs 423+ packages without vulnerabilities

### Build and Development Commands
- **Development server**: `npm run dev`
  - Starts in approximately 1 second using Turbopack
  - Runs on http://localhost:3000 (or next available port like 3001)
  - NEVER CANCEL: Server starts quickly but may take time for hot reloads
  - Set timeout to 60+ seconds for any build operations

- **Production build**: `npm run build`
  - Takes approximately 14 seconds with Turbopack optimization
  - NEVER CANCEL: Build process is fast but critical for deployment
  - Set timeout to 120+ seconds to be safe
  - Generates optimized static pages and API routes

- **Production start**: `npm run start`
  - **KNOWN ISSUE**: Currently fails with routes manifest error when using Turbopack
  - Use after running `npm run build`
  - For production testing, use `npm run dev` instead

- **Linting**: `npm run lint`
  - Takes approximately 3 seconds to complete
  - Currently has 25 errors and 42 warnings (mostly TypeScript `any` types and unused variables)
  - Build succeeds despite linting issues due to `ignoreBuildErrors: true` in next.config.ts
  - NEVER CANCEL: Linting provides valuable feedback

## Application Structure and Navigation

### Key Directories
```
/src/app/          - Next.js app router pages and API routes
â”œâ”€â”€ api/           - API endpoints for auth, devices, homes, scenes
â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard/     - Main device management interface  
â”œâ”€â”€ login/         - Authentication pages
â””â”€â”€ page.tsx       - Homepage with QR login

/src/components/   - Reusable UI components
â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard/     - Dashboard-specific components
â”œâ”€â”€ layout/        - Layout components (sidebar, etc.)
â””â”€â”€ ui/           - Base UI components (buttons, cards, etc.)

/src/lib/          - Business logic and utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ mijia/         - Xiaomi Mijia API integration
â”œâ”€â”€ api.ts         - API client wrapper
â”œâ”€â”€ store.ts       - State management
â””â”€â”€ utils.ts       - Utility functions
```

### API Routes
- `/api/auth/qr` - QR code authentication
- `/api/auth/qr-test` - Test QR code generation
- `/api/devices` - Device management
- `/api/devices/[id]` - Individual device control
- `/api/homes` - Home/room management  
- `/api/scenes/[homeId]` - Scene management
- `/api/scenes/run` - Execute scenes

## Validation and Testing

### CRITICAL: Manual Validation Requirements
After making any changes, ALWAYS run through these complete scenarios:

1. **Homepage QR Generation Flow**:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000
   - Click "Táº¡o mÃ£ QR" button
   - Verify error handling when Xiaomi service unavailable (expected: shows "Lá»—i khi táº¡o mÃ£ QR" with retry button)
   - Test retry functionality

2. **Dashboard Interface**:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000/dashboard  
   - Verify dashboard loads with device statistics (0 devices expected without auth)
   - Test tab navigation between "Thiáº¿t bá»‹", "Ká»‹ch báº£n", "Chia sáº»"
   - Verify responsive cyberpunk-themed UI

3. **Login Page Functionality**:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000/login
   - Test tab switching between "ðŸ“± QR Code" and "ðŸ‘¤ TÃ i khoáº£n" 
   - Verify QR generation button works
   - Check cyberpunk styling and animations

### Build Validation
ALWAYS run these commands after making changes:
```bash
npm run lint    # Check for code issues (expect warnings, not errors)
npm run build   # Verify production build succeeds (14s, NEVER CANCEL)
npm run dev     # Test development server (1s startup, NEVER CANCEL)
```

### Linting Expectations
- Current linting shows 67 problems (25 errors, 42 warnings)
- Most errors are TypeScript `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` 
- Build succeeds despite errors due to `ignoreBuildErrors: true`
- Do NOT fix unrelated linting issues unless directly related to your changes

## Technology Stack and Configuration

### Core Technologies
- **Next.js 15.5.2** with Turbopack for fast builds
- **React 19.1.0** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS 4** with custom cyberpunk theme
- **Radix UI** components for accessibility
- **Zustand** for state management
- **QRCode.js** for QR generation

### Key Configuration Files
- `next.config.ts` - Next.js config with build error ignoring
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Custom cyberpunk theme with animations
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `eslint.config.mjs` - ESLint rules (extends Next.js standards)
- `package.json` - Dependencies and npm scripts

### Environment and Dependencies
- Uses `--turbopack` flag for faster development and builds
- No test framework configured (no Jest, Cypress, or Playwright)
- No Docker or deployment configuration present
- Runs on Node.js with standard npm package management

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding New Features
1. ALWAYS run the validation scenarios first to establish baseline
2. Use existing component patterns from `/src/components/ui/`
3. Follow the cyberpunk theme color scheme (cyber-primary: #00fff7, etc.)
4. Add API routes in `/src/app/api/` following existing patterns
5. Update Mijia integration in `/src/lib/mijia/` if needed

### Debugging Issues
1. Check browser console for errors (app uses extensive console logging)
2. Verify development server is running on correct port
3. Check API route responses in Network tab
4. Examine Zustand store state for client-side issues

### UI Development
- Components use Tailwind classes with custom cyberpunk theme
- Animations use CSS keyframes defined in `tailwind.config.ts`
- Icons from `lucide-react` library
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

## Important Notes and Limitations

### Current Limitations
- QR authentication requires connection to Xiaomi services (may fail in sandboxed environments)
- No automated test suite - rely on manual validation
- Linting has many warnings but build succeeds
- No CI/CD pipeline configured
- **Production start (`npm run start`) currently fails with Turbopack - use `npm run dev` for testing**

### Performance Considerations
- Turbopack provides fast builds and hot reloads
- Images should use Next.js Image component (current warnings about `<img>` tags)
- API calls have proper error handling but may timeout without external connectivity

### Security Notes
- Authentication tokens handled in Zustand store
- API routes include proper error handling
- No sensitive credentials in codebase (uses environment variables pattern)

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures
- Run `npm install` if dependencies are missing
- Clear `.next` directory and rebuild if cache issues occur
- Check Node.js version compatibility

### Development Server Issues  
- Port conflicts: Server auto-assigns available port (3000, 3001, etc.)
- Hot reload issues: Restart development server
- Style conflicts: Clear browser cache

### API Connection Issues
- Expected behavior: QR generation fails without Xiaomi service access
- Dashboard shows empty state without authentication
- Error messages provide user feedback
